# Customer operation and transport inventory

Current HTTP CLI commands use REST exclusively. The command-era HTTP inventory
below is historical; current transport availability is documented in
[REST migration](../docs/rest-api.md). SSH retains the command protocol.

Reviewed 2026-10-09 against the server working tree. See `server-baseline.json`
for source fingerprints and `docs/status.md` for verification progress. Protocol
availability is distinct from client implementation and integration coverage.
Authority is always decided by the server; permission-aware HELP is the discovery
source. Browser presence alone does not imply a supported bearer API.

| Operation | Server surface | Authentication/authority | Current Go client / CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ping / server info / identity | PING / SERVER INFO / AUTH INFO | Bearer HTTP or registered SSH key; server/identity discovery permissions | Typed identity and server info available; real HTTP checks pass |
| Permission-aware discovery | HELP [topic] | Bearer or SSH; help.get | Typed Go Help and builder; CLI server help; real HTTP verification passes |
| Personal account / quotas | ACCOUNT INFO / ACCOUNT QUOTA LIST | Bearer or SSH; current principal's account | Typed Go account/quota methods and builders; CLI account info/quotas; real HTTP verification passes |
| Personal translation library | ACCOUNT TRANSLATION LIST/ADD/REMOVE | Bearer or SSH; account library authority and effective quotas | Both available; fixtures verify list grammar |
| Read / search | READ / SEARCH | Bearer or SSH; enabled library and translation.read/search | Raw and typed reading/search available; real verse/chapter/book/search and empty search verified |
| Translation metadata / reference catalogue | TRANSLATION INFO/CATALOG | Bearer or SSH; translation.get | Typed Go methods/builders and CLI available; real metadata/catalogue verification passes |
| Live create/list/info/stats | LIVE CREATE/LIST/<id> INFO/STATS | Bearer or SSH; Live permissions/access; stats owner-only | Typed state/list/stats available; Go HTTP integration covers lifecycle and stats |
| Live start/stop/pause/resume/clear/delete | LIVE <id> action | Bearer or SSH; mutation authority | Typed control acknowledgements; real start/stop/pause/resume/clear/delete verified |
| Live settings and stack | LIVE <id> SET / STACK actions | Bearer or SSH; Live update/get authority, library and running-state constraints | Typed settings/stack/push/pop results; real integration passes |
| Secret generation/removal | LIVE <id> SECRET CREATE/ROTATE/DELETE | Bearer or SSH; owner and update authority | Builders and CLI available; decoder fixtures cover create/rotate |
| Secret connection authentication | LIVE <id> SECRET <value> | SSH connection state; HTTP discards resulting connection state | Builder/CLI available; cannot authorize a later fresh SSH connection |
| Custom secret assignment | Reference documents SECRET SET; parser rejects it | Intended owner/update authority | CLI rejects it explicitly; server contract unresolved |
| Audience subscription | LIVE <id> SUBSCRIBE | Persistent SSH; audience permission or secret authorization on same connection | CLI SSH path available; HTTP rejects; actual OpenSSH verse/pause/disconnect/reconnect/closure integration passes |
| Personal manual tokens / SSH keys | ACCOUNT TOKEN / ACCOUNT KEY | Bearer or SSH; personal credential authority/quotas | Typed ListTokens and CLI account tokens verified; key and token mutation methods remain planned |
| Browser CLI authorization | /cli/auth, /api/cli/token, /api/cli/logout | PKCE approval and bearer revocation; username onboarding required | CLI uses library ExchangeCode/RevokeCredential; real HTTP exchange/replay/revocation checks and 4 server PKCE tests pass |
| Organization directory / own application status | ORGANIZATION LIST / ORGANIZATION APPLICATION <id> STATUS (foundation contract) | Active authenticated personal principal and server.get; bearer or SSH | SDK typed builders/results and CLI list/application status with capability discovery; no submission, join or admin approval command |
| Organization selection and administration | Browser organization routes/domain services | Approved organization and active scoped membership; browser session/CSRF | Public mutation/workspace-selection commands deferred |
| Live workspace movement, collaboration, reorder/removal | Dashboard control/invitation endpoints | Browser session/CSRF and current access | No client wrapping of browser APIs; public contract needed |
| Audience WebSocket | /ws?live=<id> | Browser account/audience cookie | No bearer client transport |
| Management WebSocket | /dashboard/api/lives/<id>/events | Browser session, Origin check, current management access | Separate from audience; no bearer client transport |
| Organization Live design | /organizations/<handle>/live-design | Scoped design permission; browser session/CSRF; revision conflicts | Browser feature; public client surface deferred |
| Operator RBAC / translation installation | AUTH ACTOR/ROLE and TRANSLATION FETCH/DELETE | Server administration authority | Outside initial customer CLI scope |

## Shared HTTP constraints

- HTTP resource requests use versioned REST JSON. SSH exec uses protocol v1.
- 8192 command bytes and 16384 JSON-body bytes; measure UTF-8 bytes, not characters.
- Domain errors can use HTTP 200. Rate limiting uses HTTP 429 plus ERR metadata;
  malformed/oversized requests may return JSON errors with HTTP 400/413.
- CLI login credentials have a separate active cap of 10; manual tokens use plan
  quotas. Scopes may narrow authority and tokens can expire or be revoked.
- No mutation retries. A timeout does not establish whether a mutation committed.

## Outstanding server discrepancies

`SECRET SET` documentation differs from the parser and remains server-owned.
The assessment fixed duplicate `LIVE STATS` counts on 2026-10-10. Canonical
fixtures now use one count derived from subscriber records; older identical
values remain accepted by the client, and conflicting values are rejected.
Fresh local full integration passes 27 decoder and 18 encoder fixtures,
7 targeted security cases, all 11 Go HTTP subtests, real OpenSSH subscription
lifecycle/profile output checks and 8 auth/SSH EUnit tests. Source fingerprints
in `server-baseline.json` identify the tested working tree (2026-10-10).


The assessment fixed token scope serialization using permission CSV. Real token
metadata integration passes, including permission denial and inactive-token filtering.

The assessment also fixed an intermediate normal Live-deletion regression during
stream authorization changes. The real OpenSSH subscription once again receives
EVENT closed; the complete integration run passes.

Latest assessment validation (2026-10-10) additionally passes all 10 import-access
and 14 publication cases via `--imports`, including immutable generations,
concurrent archives and retained handles. The server source and test fingerprints
in `server-baseline.json` matched the working tree at completion. This closes
the prior translation/registry snapshot gap; later edits need revalidation.
